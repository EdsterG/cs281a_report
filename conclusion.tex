\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this work, we developed methods for guiding search
through a plan refinement graph in a TAMP system, using machine
learning based on expert demonstrations. Thus, the system learned to
intelligently navigate this graph, making a decision of both which node
to explore next and whether to attempt to refine this node or generate
a geometric fact for replanning. We evaluated performance against a baseline
strategy and a previous approach to the problem, and we found that
our method outperformed both substantially. Future work includes trying
different inverse reinforcement learning algorithms, using non-linear
combinations of the features (e.g. by learning a neural network to score actions),
and expanding our approach to different experimental domains.
